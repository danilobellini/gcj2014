Google Code Jam 2014
====================

Repository with the code I wrote for the GCJ (Google Code Jam) 2014.

The problem description for each problem is in the ``README.rst`` file in the
problem directory.

All my code is written as ``go.py`` scripts that receives the input file name
as a parameter and outputs a ``output.txt`` file. Some output files were added
to this repository, renamed to match the input file used to create them.
